# ArtofBugs' Dotfiles

Various configs and Bash aliases I use or have used.
Feel free to copy or modify!
Don't expect this to be complete or up-to-date.

To include a file of Bash aliases, use this in your `.bashrc`:

```bash
if [ -f ~/.NAME_aliases ]; then
    . ~/.NAME_aliases
fi
```

## Currently included dotfiles
